On the back of its leadership in digital payments, PhonePe has expanded into financial services (Insurance, Mutual Funds, Stock Broking, and Lending) as well as adjacent tech-enabled businesses such as Pincode for hyperlocal shopping and Indus App Store which is India's first localized App Store. The PhonePe Group is a portfolio of businesses aligned with the company's vision to offer every Indian an equal opportunity to accelerate their progress by unlocking the flow of money and access to services.\nCulture\nAt PhonePe, we take extra care to make sure you give your best at work, Everyday! And creating the right environment for you is just one of the things we do. We empower people and trust them to do the right thing. Here, you own your work from start to finish, right from day one. Being enthusiastic about tech is a big part of being at PhonePe. If you like building technology that impacts millions, ideating with some of the best minds in the country and executing on your dreams with purpose and speed, join us!\nWhy PhonePe:\nAt PhonePe our vision is to provide financial inclusion to a billion Indians. Today we have made significant progress on this vision by making digital payments far simpler and ubiquitous than it has ever been. However we wish to make it so easy, safe, and universally accepted that people never feel the need to carry cash or cards again. And not just in Urban India. At PhonePe, our aim to transform the entire Indian landscape so that every Indian, in every corner of the country, makes significant economic progress. Onwards and upwards! That is our goal.\nWhy PhonePe Design:\nIf you are sold on the vision of the company, you may want to consider the design team as a place to make this a reality. The design team at PhonePe is a bunch of creative trailblazers who are leading the effort to make a dent in the fintech universe. The design team consists of Product Designers, Visual Designers, Graphic & Motion Designers, and Illustrators who are all engaged in blending art and science into a promising value proposition for our users.\nWe are looking for someone with the following qualities:\n2 + years of experience in software product design. Working on consumer products would be an additional advantage. BTW, fintech does not earn you extra brownie points, but we certainly don\u2019t mind it.\nAn obsession to create intuitive and beautiful products and experiences. We will require a portfolio of work to judge this. But don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t judge your designer OCD.\nAn expert at your craft. This means you can endlessly argue about the relative merits of Figma, Sketch, and XD and know exactly how to create super cool micro-interactions using Principle, AfterEffects, and ProtoPie.\nA collaborative team player who can work well with Product, Engineering, Business, and CX teams to ensure that everyone is aligned with the design vision.\nYou should have shipped products and if they have done well you should know why. But if they have not done well, we expect you to be able to lecture people on how to avoid the pitfalls.\nYou should have the ability to talk business. And no, we do not expect you to wear a suit.\nHere\u2019s what you will do in this role:\nCreating fantastic products starts with obsessing about the \u2018Why\u2019 and backing it up with a solid understanding of user needs and behavior. So do expect a lot of good quality heated discussions and we want someone who is able to walk up to a whiteboard (or online board) and sketch out ideas and solutions.\nThese ideas and solutions would need to be built into robust user flows that would take care of every conceivable use case and condition.\nFlows are nothing if they are not translated into screens that are consistent, intuitive but at the same time factor in delight.\nFinally working with the Product and Engineering teams to bring the designs into reality is a crucial part of the designer\u2019s journey.\nHowever, at PhonePe, a designer\u2019s journey does not end there. We are looking at designers who are obsessed with numbers and can track both growth and usability issues just by looking at the numbers.\nSo the question is, do you think the points mentioned above describe you to a tee? If so, get in touch with us. Not only will you find the work satisfying, you will also be part of one of India\u2019s fastest-growing companies. And together we will be able to build one of the finest bands to have come out of India.\nPhonePe. Karte Ja. Badhte Ja.\nPhonePe Full Time Employee Benefits (Not applicable for Intern or Contract Roles)\nInsurance Benefits - Medical Insurance, Critical Illness Insurance, Accidental Insurance, Life Insurance\nWellness Program - Employee Assistance Program, Onsite Medical Center, Emergency Support System\nParental Support - Maternity Benefit, Paternity Benefit Program, Adoption Assistance Program, Day-care Support Program\nMobility Benefits - Relocation benefits, Transfer Support Policy, Travel Policy\nRetirement Benefits - Employee PF Contribution, Flexible PF Contribution, Gratuity, NPS, Leave Encashment\nOther Benefits - Higher Education Assistance, Car Lease, Salary Advance Policy\nWorking at PhonePe is a rewarding experience!
